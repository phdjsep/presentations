# A UseR’s Intro to ML in AWS

#### Speaker: **Emily Robinson**
* Emily Robinson is a data science consultant. She previously worked at Warby Parker, where she worked on a centralized team tackling some of the company's biggest projects. Previously she worked at DataCamp, where she built and ran their experimentation analytics system, and at Etsy, where she worked with their search team. With Jacqueline Nolis, she is the author of Build a Career in Data Science, a guide to all the non-technical skills and knowledge you need to get a job in data science: http://datascicareer.com/

* “The cloud” can be intimidating, but with a few packages you can get up and running with a deep learning model on a giant computer in no time. In this talk, I’ll introduce one tool for doing ML in the cloud, AWS SageMaker. We’ll walk through all the code and tools needed to make an image classification algorithm on one of the toughest problems of our time: predicting what rating a dog’s photo will get from WeRateDogs (@dog_rates). No background in deep learning, image classification, or working in the cloud needed!
